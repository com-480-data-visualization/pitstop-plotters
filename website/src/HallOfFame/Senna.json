  "description": "Ayrton Senna da Silva, born in Brazil in 1960, was a legendary Formula One driver who won three World Championships (1988, 1990, 1991) and held a record of 65 pole positions until 2006. Senna started in karting and moved to open-wheel racing, winning the British Formula Three Championship in 1983. He joined Formula One in 1984, racing for teams like Toleman, Lotus, and McLaren, where he had a notable rivalry with Alain Prost. Known for his mastery in qualifying and wet races, Senna won six Monaco Grands Prix. His career ended tragically in 1994 during the San Marino Grand Prix when he died in a crash while leading the race for Williams."
