Hamilton, who began his career in the McLaren Young Driver Programme in 1998, has won a record seven Formula One World Drivers\' Championship titles, tied with Michael Schumacher. He holds the records for the most wins (103), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (197) in the history of the sport. Hamilton\'s career started with McLaren in 2007, where he became the first black driver in Formula One and narrowly missed the championship by one point in his debut season. He clinched his first title in 2008, becoming the then-youngest world champion.\\n\\nIn 2013, Hamilton moved to Mercedes, where he has enjoyed a highly successful period, especially following the 2014 regulation changes that introduced turbo-hybrid engines. He won six additional titles with Mercedes, dominating the sport alongside rivals like Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel. Off the track, Hamilton has broadened Formula One\'s appeal through his lifestyle, activism in environmental and racial issues, and involvement in music and fashion. Recognized as one of Time\'s 100 most influential people in 2020, Hamilton was knighted in 2021 and continues to influence the sport and its culture. He is set to join Ferrari for the 2025 season."}')}}]);
