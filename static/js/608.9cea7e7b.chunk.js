He is celebrated for winning the Formula One World Drivers\' Championship three times (1988, 1990, and 1991) and for his record-setting 65 pole positions until 2006. Senna began his career in karting, advancing to open-wheel racing by 1981, and won the British Formula Three Championship in 1983. He entered Formula One in 1984 with Toleman Motorsport, later joining Team Lotus and subsequently McLaren, where he experienced significant success, including a fierce rivalry with teammate Alain Prost. This rivalry peaked during the 1989 and 1990 Japanese Grands Prix, which were decisive in those years\' championships. Known for his exceptional skill in qualifying and wet conditions, Senna secured six Monaco Grand Prix victories and remains one of the most successful drivers in the history of Formula One. His career, marked by both remarkable achievements and controversies, ended abruptly when he died in a crash while leading a race, driving for Williams."}')}}]);
