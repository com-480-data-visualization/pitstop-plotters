Notably, he still holds the record for the most consecutive Drivers\' Championships and the most total fastest laps (77).\\n\\nSchumacher started his racing career in karting, progressing to Formula One in 1991. He first raced with Benetton, winning two championships, and then moved to Ferrari, where he won five consecutive titles from 2000 to 2004.
